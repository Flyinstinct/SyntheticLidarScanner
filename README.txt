A synthetic LiDAR scanner for VTK.

Non-interactive version
-----------------------
vtkLidarScanner can be used as shown in vtkLidarScannerExample.cxx to create a synthetic LiDAR scan of a 3D mesh (a vtkPolyData).

Interactive version
-------------------
A Qt GUI is provided to position the scanner relative to the object and set the scan parameters. This can be seen by running
SyntheticLidarScanner.cpp.
